##My top 3 projects that I am currently working on:
### [Person Register](https://github.com/BaibaNi/personRegister_separate_files)
Allows you to register a person in the database by name, surname and personal ID code. 
This project was challenging when I wanted to improve the code by separating it into multiple files. 
I still have to improve the Exception handling, but I think it's great.

### [Sign-up and Log-in page](https://github.com/BaibaNi/SignLogIn)

So far, one of the voluminous projects (in terms of code amount) I have been working on. 
During this project I learned a lot: installing MySQL and other tools to manage the database, 
creating forms that permit a user to log-in or sign-up, formatting HTML forms with CSS. 
And then I realized, that most likely many people can't even imagine, 
how complex system is behind the tools they use daily.

### [Stock Markets](https://github.com/BaibaNi/stockAPI)

Follow the Stock Market trends and search the ones you have the most interest in. 
Project using APIs with a very simple interface. While working on this project, 
I learned the principles of using APIs and how to access necessary data.
